Occupancy states, settings and other details:
While ST has a concept of rooms it is essentially a grouping mechanism which does not enable personalized automation. In contrast rooms occupancy considers the room as a meta device and automates common tasks associated with a ‚Äúroom‚Äù physical or virtual. What makes it really useful is not just the room's occupancy state but the ability to manage automation for rooms in a set of rules for the room based on the occupancy state of the room and data from various sensors. When creating a room device through the smartapp you are able to create these rules for the rooms making your rooms really smart.

You can continue reading here for the summarized version or read the more detailed and always the latest version on Github which also describes the individual settings:

Rooms Manager and Rooms Occupancy readme on Github

What these rules enable is many common tasks around rooms which most users go through automating at some point. Usually through setting up a few rules or using a few pistons. I have been there and done that myself. While those work to a degree it requires creating a set of rules and/or pistons to enable contextual automation per "room". As you incorporate more and more automation using rules and/or pistons these often become a maintenance challenge while still not enabling the kind of comprehensive automation that should be possible for typical devices in a room. The goal of this app is to make that possible by evaluating all sensor input from various devices in the room and enabling rules that act on these sensor values in the context of various typical automation needs in a "room".

If there is one principle that these apps are built on, it is - that your home automation should work in the background in a repeatable and predictable manner without requiring repeated human intervention. In short, your automation should work for you and not the other way around. But even more importantly perhaps, this app gets you the kind of WAF for your home automation that you have always dreamed about. üôÇ

Additionally, these room occupancy devices also have attributes, capabilities and commands which are useable in webCoRE or other smartapps like Smart Lighting in ST or Rule Machine in Hubitat. There is a range of other automations that webCoRE makes possible that could not otherwise be done without writing a custom smartapp for it. I use webCoRE for that and am I big fan of Adrian. So checkout webCoRE as well if you don't already use it.

One last time, please consider continuing reading the rest of this readme on Github because that always has the most updated version:

Rooms Manager and Rooms Occupancy readme on Github

How does this app work?
This app works by setting rooms occupancy to various states based on a set of sensors as specified by the user. It takes this state and attribute values from various sensors and evaluates a set of rules that you create to match the conditions. When all of the conditions for the rule matches, it executes actions specified on these matching rules.

As an example, you can specify motion sensors in Occupied settings to set a room state to Occupied when there is motion from any of those motion sensors. Then create a rule to turn on some lights. In this rule you could also set that these lights should only be turned on if a lux sensor is at a certain lux value or lower. Or you could specify that only turn on the lights during certain times. Or you could specify turn on the lights at a certain level during certain times and at another level during other times.

As a part of the Occupied settings you can also specify timeout values so the room does not indefinitely stay set to Occupied state and the lights turn off after a while when there is no motion. How quickly that happens is controlled by you through the timeout value you specify in the settings. By specifying settings in the Checking settings you are also able to dim the lights before the lights turn off completely so there is a visual cue to the room occupant that the lights will turn off because they have not moved in a while.

Off course you may be in the room while and not be moving for a while like reading a book or watching TV. That's when you use the Engaged settings to set the room to Engaged state. See below for additional details.

Here are the common room occupancy states:

Occupied:
Occupied is you go to a room are in there for a few minutes then leave the room. Lights come on when you enter the room and turn off after a couple of minutes of your leaving the room. Think of Occupied as a transient state and Engaged below as a somewhat persistent state.


Engaged:
Engaged is when you stay in a room for an extended period of time and may be motionless for some or all of the time. since we cant depend on the motion event for engaged state there are different options to set the room to engaged for extended occupancy. these are all under engaged settings and there is more coming. but these help make sure the switches you set to on stay on even if there is no motion in the room. When in Engaged state you have a different and longer timeout state than the Occupied state. So there is still a motion requirement but a much higher time threshold than the Occupied state.


Asleep:
Asleep state is meant for use while the room should be 'asleep' as in not respond to most typical automation like motion automation. But it does allow for other automation like using a night light and using a button to turn on or off the night lights. You are still able to create rules for the Asleep state but it additionally support a little bit for Asleep state specific automation in the Asleep settings.


Vacant:
Vacant state is for when the room is vacant and you want everything to get turned off. It is possible to setup rules for Vacant settings as well but not required.


Checking:
Occupied state is used for transition between states and not user controlled. For example, when moving from Occupied to Vacant occupancy state the room will transition to Checking state. While the app does not allow creating rules for checking state there is some settings available to control dimming of the lights when in Checking state.


Locked:
Locked state disables all automations for the room and allows you to control lights and other devices in the room either manually or some other way.

The states 'locked', 'reserved', 'kaput' and 'donotdisturb' are effectively all similar in that they all disable automation. That being the case there is some sensors allowed to set / unset rooms to / from Locked state but no other automation beyond that for these occupancy states. Here is a quick description of the various top level settings and how the app works. At the heart of the app is the concept of room states and rules to automate devices based on these room's states and other sensor inputs. (In the following description when I talk about sensors it refers to devices that have attributes which are used to drive decisions in the room's rules.)

Note: Many of the following settings are optional but when specified will require other settings to be specified. Like specifying a motion sensor is optional. But if you do specify a motion sensor the motion event to trigger timeout countdown becomes required.

Top level settings:

Room Devices
Room sensors used in checking rule conditions based occupancy state and data from these sensors.

Motion sensor(s)	Room motion sensor(s) for motion activated state change like Occupied or Engaged
Motion event	Motion event to use for timeout. Choose the motion active event to start the timeout if your motion sensor does not generate a motion inactive event following the motion active event rather stays continuously active with no inactive event in between.
Room Buttons	Select up to 5 buttons all of which will allow toggling through selected states.
Selected states	Select states room buttons above will toggle through.
Presence sensor(s)	Presence sensor to associate with the room. Helps control certain room actions based on presence state
Lux sensor	Room lux sensor to use with rules for lights and switches. For some rooms specifying an outdoor sensor might work better than a room lux sensor.
Humidity sensor	Room humidity sensor to use with rules for lights and switches
Music player	Room music player to use with rules for lights and switches
Power meter	Room power sensor to use with rules for lights and switches
Window shade	Room window shade to use in rules
 

The next 6 settings group are for how the room is set to each of those 6 occupancy states and settings specific to that occupancy state.
 


Occupied Settings
Settings that specify how this occupancy state is set. Normally it is based on motion but there are also other ways of detecting Occupied state like a specific switch turning on. Available settings:

Button	Set room occupancy to Occupied state when button is pushed
Button number	Button number of button selected above
Only sets Occupied	Option to turn off toggling between Occupied and Vacant state for this button. When set to true the button will only set Occupied state and no longer toggle. This helps if you are pressing a button with no visual feedback to set the room to Occupied but accidentally press it twice and don't want the room to toggle to Vacant state when it is already in Occupied state.
Switch	Switch which when turned on will set room occupancy state to Occupied
Timeout	Value in seconds for room state timeout after last motion event
 


Engaged Settings
Settings that specify how this occupancy state is set. Normally it is based on motion but there are also other ways of detecting Engaged state like a button being pressed.

When room is busy	Set room to Engaged state if Occupied state is triggered frequently in a short period of time and the lights should stay on for longer than in Occupied state.

Counts the number of time the occupancy state changes between Engaged <> Occupied <> Checking <> Vacant within ((Occupied no motion timer + Checking dim timer) * 10).

Count = 5:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉLight traffic.
Count = 7:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉMedium traffic.
Count = 9:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉHeavy traffic.

This is to automate Engaged state for when the room is flipping between Occupied and Vacant frequently in a short period of time.

Button	Set room occupancy to Engaged state when button is pushed
Button number	Button number of button selected above
Only sets Engaged	Option to turn off toggling between Engaged and Vacant state for this button. When set to true the button will only set Engaged state and no longer toggle. This helps if you are pressing a button with no visual feedback to set the room to Engaged but accidentally press it twice and don't want the room to toggle to Vacant state when it is already in Engaged state.
Presence sensor actions	Choose if room occupancy state should switch with presence sensor:
Arrives:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÇChange room occupancy to Engaged.
Departs:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇChange room occupancy to Vacant.
Both:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÇBoth of the actions.
Neither:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉNone of the actions.
Keep room engaged with presence	Keeps room occupancy set to Engaged when presence sensor is present
When music playing	Keeps room occupancy set to Engaged when music is playing
Switch	Switch which when turned on will set room occupancy to Engaged and when turned off will set room occupancy to Vacant.
Power value	Power value in watts which when reached will set room occupancy to Engaged
Power time range	Allows specifying time range from - to and matches to current time when evaluating power value for setting state. Supports the following values:
Sunrise:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉMatches to local sunrise time with offset if specified
Sunset:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÇMatches to local sunset time with offset if specified
Time:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÇMatches to specific time/li>
Trigger from vacant	When false room will need to be in a state other than Vacant for the Asleep state to be triggered
Power stays below	Power value has to stay below power value above for this many seconds before room state timeout countdown will start. This is keep room state from changing frequently with power value fluctuating.
Contact sensor	Contact sensor(s) when closed will set room occupancy to Engaged with motion
Outside door	For use with outside doors like garage doors where the Engaged state is triggered with motion if the door is open
Does not trigger Engaged	For use with areas like landing or hallway leading to different rooms with contact sensor on those doors. You want any of the room doors opening to turn on the lights even before the landing/hallway motion sensor detects motion but you do not want these doors to set the landing/hallway to Engaged. Turn on this setting in that case.
Timeout	Value in seconds for room occupancy timeout from Engaged to Vacant
Reset Engaged/Asleep	Reset Engaged or Asleep state when another room changes to Engaged or Asleep
Reset Engaged directly	Reset room occupancy to Vacant directly without transitioning through Checking state
 


Checking Settings
Settings for timeout and light levels while in checking state.

Dim timer	Dim lights for how many seconds for visible notification of checking state and that lights and switches will be turned off.
Dim level by	If any lights are on dim them by this level.
Dim level to	If no lights are on turn them on at this level.
Lux value?	If no lights are on turn them on only when lux is at or below this lux value.
Do not restore	When transitioning from Checking state to another state do not restore the light levels to their previous value if that state is Vacant.


Vacant Settings
Settings that specify how this occupancy state is set. Normally it is based on motion but there are also other ways of detecting Occupied state like a specific switch turning off.

Button	Set room occupancy to Vacant state when button is pushed
Button number	Button number of button selected above
Switch	Switch which when turned off will set room occupancy to Vacant
Stop music	Pause music player when room occupancy changes to Vacant
 


Asleep Settings
Settings that specify how this occupancy state is set. Asleep is tricky because there is no true commonly used physical asleep sensors. So, these settings allow other ways of setting Asleep occupancy state and specifying night light settings which are a little different from how lights work through the rules.

Sleep sensor	Sleep sensor to set room occupancy to Asleep. (not a lot of device option here that supports sleep state. some users use the webCoRE presence sensor which I had originally modified to support sleep state, subsequently Adrian added the sleep state code to main.)
Button	Set room occupancy to Asleep state when button is pushed
Button number	Button number of button selected above
Only sets Asleep	Option to turn off toggling between Asleep and Vacant state for this button. When set to true the button will only set Asleep state and no longer toggle.

Trigger from vacant	When false room will need to be in a state other than Vacant for the Asleep state to be triggered
Power stays below	Power value has to stay below power value above for this many seconds before room state timeout countdown will start. This is to keep room state from changing frequently with power value fluctuating.
Timeout	Option to turn off Asleep state after certain number of hours in case you forget to turn it off in the morning. Specially useful if you do not have a contact sensor on the bedroom doors.
Reset with Contact	Option to turn off Asleep state after certain number of hours in case you forget to turn it off in the morning
Night lights:
Settings for night lights with motion while in Asleep state.

Turn on	Switches to turn on with motion while in Asleep state
Level	Set level when turning on switches above
Color temperature	Set color temperature when turning on switches above

Contact	Contact to set room occupancy to Locked
Open or closed	Set Locked state when contact is open or closed
Switches off	When true turn off switches when room occupancy changes to Locked
Override	When true allows use of devices in Locked state that would otherwise cause another room state to be activated.
Timeout	Option to turn off Locked state after certain number of hours
 

These group of settings allow for light routine settings used in the rules.

Auto Level 'AL' Settings
Settings to specify auto level and color temperature settings for the room which allows using 'AL' as a light level rule to automatically calculate and use these values based on time of day, wake and sleep time specified.

For a github install from repo in ST use : owner: adey / name: bangali / branch: master. Install and publish the rooms occupancy DTH then install and publish the rooms manager and rooms child app smartapps. So 1 device driver and 2 smartapps ALL need to be saved and published before using the smartapp.

For a manual install contact the coder @ h20rider83@bellsouth.net, in order of DTHs and smartapps you should save and publish.

rooms occupancy DTH:

rooms child smartapp:

Then go to ST app -> Automation tab -> Add a Smartapp -> My apps in ST app and install rooms manager app then create your rooms within rooms manager.

When creating a room first give the room a name and save the room then go back in to the room to add various settings to the room. This is because the app uses app state to manage the rules and in ST the app state is not consistent till the app has been saved once.

Non-obvious rules:
1. Outdoor lights with no motion sensor?

Setup a room say `Outdoor` with the following settings specified for the rule:
Name of the rule.
Time from and to settings when the lights should turn on and off respectively.
Lights or other switches to turn off.
Optionally you can also specify the level, color and color temperature or use a Holiday Light rule that you have setup.
The light will turn on at the time from time and turn off at the time to time. Off course you could create multiple such rules in this Outdoor room to turn off different lights at different times even on different days of the week.
2. Turn off switches after X seconds with no motion sensor? (power saver)

Setup a room with the following Engaged settings:
Set the switches you want turned off as engaged switches.
Specify the seconds after which you want the light turned off as the timeout setting.
Then add a rule with the following settings:
Name of the rule.
